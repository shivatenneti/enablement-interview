## <span style="color: blue;">Packer and Terraform Deployment Workflow</span>

Packer and Terraform workflow:

- Use Packer to create a custom AMI with packer.json.
- Obtain the AMI ID generated by Packer
- Configure main.tf to reference the AMI ID.
- Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
- Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes.
- Run `terraform apply` to deploy the EC2 instance using the AMI.

Benefits of the Integration:

- Infrastructure as Code for consistent and reproducible deployments
- Version control and automation of infrastructure lifecycle

Talk about the Packer AMI Image, and how Terraform can deply the EC2 Instances with the produced AMI
